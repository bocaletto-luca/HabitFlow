# HabitFlow

HabitFlow is a single-page web application that lets you track and visualize daily habits without any server-side code. With independent toggles for Monthly, Weekly, Daily and Stats views, you can mark activities as completed, inspect your progress in a heatmap calendar or interactive tables, and analyze completion rates with bar charts. Add habits with custom emoji icons and optional reminder times, switch between light and dark themes, and back up or restore your data via JSON export/import. Built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, it uses Day.js for date handling, Chart.js for charts, Web Notifications for reminders, and localStorage for persistence.
